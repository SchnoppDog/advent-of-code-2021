# Advent of Code 2021

This repository shows my effort for this years advent of code. I want to mention that I code just as a hobby. I am no expert and I don't have a lot of experience in writing efficient and best-practice code.

## About "create_days.py"

With this file you are able to create the days with the following structure:

```txt
src/days/
|--- 01
    |--- example.txt
    |--- task_1.txt
    |--- task_2.txt
    |--- Readme.md
    |--- main.py
```

You can of course change the default path from `src/days/` to any path you'd like to. You can also create all days with its correspondending files or just a single day.
